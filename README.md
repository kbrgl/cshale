# cshale
Toy shell written in C. Precursor to (and practice for) a more complete shell I'm
writing in Rust. Probably very buggy.

**WARNING:** unclean and inelegant code. View at your own risk.

## TODO
* There's a weird bug that causes ls to fail if run too quickly after `cd ~`, I need to fix that.
